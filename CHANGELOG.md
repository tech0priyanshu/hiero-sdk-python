## [Unreleased]

### Src
- 

### Tests
- Refactor `mock_server` setup for network level TLS handling and added thread safety


### Examples


### Docs


### .github
- chore: update GitHub Actions runners from ubuntu-latest to hl-sdk-py-lin-md (#2021)
- Refactored the Advanced Issue Template to V2 with stricter prerequisites and a focus on architectural design (#2016).
- Refactored the Advanced Issue Template to ensure PR-level quality checklists do not block maintainers during issue creation (#2036)
- Add automated label sync workflow to propagate labels from linked issues to pull requests (#1716)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- Add `__repr__` method to `TokenId` class for cleaner debugging output (#1653)

### Src
- Updated `AccountUpdateTransaction.set_key()` to accept generic `Key` objects (including `KeyList` and threshold keys), rather than strictly requiring a `PublicKey`.

- Fix the TransactionGetReceiptQuery to raise ReceiptStatusError for the non-retryable and non success receipt status
- Refactor `AccountInfo` to use the existing `StakingInfo` wrapper class instead of flattened staking fields. Access is now via `info.staking_info.staked_account_id`, `info.staking_info.staked_node_id`, and `info.staking_info.decline_reward`. The old flat accessors (`info.staked_account_id`, `info.staked_node_id`, `info.decline_staking_reward`) are still available as deprecated properties and will emit a `DeprecationWarning`. (#1366)
- Added abstract `Key` supper class to handle various proto Keys.
### Examples

### Tests
- Added TCK endpoint for the createAccount method
- Renamed `delegate_contract_id.py` to `delegate_contract_id_test.py` (#2004)
- Fix Flaky tests for `mock_server` by enforcing non-tls port and adding a mock_tls certificate
- Implement basic fuzz testing [#1872](https://github.com/hiero-ledger/hiero-sdk-python/issues/1872)
